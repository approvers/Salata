## What is a ActivityPub?

ActivityPub is an open-source, decentralized social networking protocol. It provides a standardized model for the communication of applications, allowing them to share activities across a network of servers.

With ActivityPub, social network users can follow each other, share posts, and interact across diverse servers using different software implementation. Its decentralized nature enables greater data ownership and control for users, as their information is not housed in one centralized server. Instead, each server retains its data and establishes its policies, thereby resisting monopoly and censorship.
