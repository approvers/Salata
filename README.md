## Features

- 🏎️ **Performance**: Pulsate is designed to be faster than other [ActivityPub](#what-is-activitypub) implementations like Misskey and Mastodon.
- 🌎 **Federation**: Pulsate is a decentralized social network that uses the ActivityPub protocol to communicate with other servers ([Misskey](https://misskey-hub.net) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) etc).
- 🪄 **Customizable**: Pulsate is designed to be easy to modify and customize. You can change the appearance, add new features, or remove existing ones. It also has an API reference and good community support, making it easy to develop third-party clients.
- 🔒 **Security**: Pulsate focuses on security, ensuring that user data is protected and secure.
- ❤️ **User Friendly**: Pulsate is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy to use.

## Project Goals

**Fast and secure ActivityPub implementation**

1. Performance oriented
2. Focus on security
3. Emphasis on ActivityPub specifications

The Pulsate Project aims to create the next generation of ActivityPub implementations that are faster than Misskey and Mastodon.

We provide software that focuses on performance improvement and security, including the response to each API request.

For more information see [here](https://spec.pulsate.dev/project.html).

## What is ActivityPub?

> [!WARNING]
>
> Pulsate has not initiated any ActivityPub-related implementations.

ActivityPub is an open-source, decentralized social networking protocol. It
provides a standardized model for the communication of applications, allowing
them to share activities across a network of servers.

With ActivityPub, social network users can follow each other, share posts, and
interact across diverse servers using different software implementation. Its
decentralized nature enables greater data ownership and control for users, as
their information is not housed in one centralized server. Instead, each server
retains its data and establishes its policies, thereby resisting monopoly and
censorship.
